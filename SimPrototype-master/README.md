# SimPrototype
This project is aimed to create a 5G channel simulator based on Unity game engine. We believe that an accurate 3D representation of an environment allows the simulator to imitate a realistic behavior of signals' propagation. We are going to use open source 3D models of New York and Berlin, which are constructed from lidar measurements.
